# Internal_structure_similarity_benchmark

We constructed a database of proteins without internal sequence and structure similarity. 
To this end, we used three sequential filters ON A a subset of the PDB composed of 28337 non-redundant chains, as determined by BLASTClust
at 30% sequence identity:


# Other benchmark databases 

The Dataset-non-TR (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.08.025) contains duplicated domains.

Some structures considered Asymmetric in the Internal symmetry dataset (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006842) have internal structure similarity.
